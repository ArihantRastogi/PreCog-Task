    "## Training a basic CNN\n",
    "The model of choice is CNN, a Convolutional Neural Network, which is a standard architecture for image classification. CNNs are effective because they can automatically detect features like edges, textures, and patterns without requiring manual feature extraction.\n",
    "### Basic Architecture\n",
    "A typical CNN consists of the following layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convolutional Layer (Conv Layer)\n",
    "    - The core building block of a CNN, responsible for feature extraction.\n",
    "    - Uses a filter (kernel) that slides over the input image, detecting patterns like edges or textures.\n",
    "    - Output of this operation is called a feature map.\n",
    "    - `nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, stride, padding)`\n",
    "2. Activation Function (ReLU - Rectified Linear Unit)\n",
    "    - Applies a non-linearity to the feature maps, introducing the ability to learn complex patterns.\n",
    "    - Helps avoid the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "    - `nn.ReLU()` \n",
    "3. Pooling Layer (Max Pooling or Average Pooling)\n",
    "    - Reduces the spatial dimensions of feature maps while keeping important information.\n",
    "    - Helps make the model translation-invariant and improves computational efficiency.\n",
    "    - `nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size, stride)`\n",
    "4. Fully Connected Layer (FC Layer)\n",
    "    - The final layers in a CNN, which convert the extracted features into predictions.\n",
    "    - Flattens the feature maps and passes them through dense layers.\n",
    "    - `nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the input images are of size 248*80 pixels, the below architecture seemed to work best along with introduction of `GradScaler`, `autocast` and `dropout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. GradScaler (`torch.amp.GradScaler()`)\n",
    "    - Purpose: Helps with mixed-precision training, which speeds up training and reduces memory usage.\n",
    "    - How?: It scales the loss value to prevent underflow when using half-precision (float16) computations.\n",
    "    - Benefit: Ensures stable updates to model weights while taking advantage of faster, lower-precision arithmetic.\n",
    "2. autocast (`torch.amp.autocast()`)\n",
    "    - Purpose: Dynamically switches between float16 and float32 precision during forward passes.\n",
    "    - How?: Uses float16 for less critical operations (e.g., matrix multiplications) and float32 for sensitive calculations (e.g., loss computation).\n",
    "    - Benefit: Improves computational efficiency while maintaining numerical stability.\n",
    "3. Dropout (`nn.Dropout()`)\n",
    "    - Purpose: Reduces overfitting by randomly setting some neuron activations to zero during training.\n",
    "    - How?: Each forward pass, a fraction of neurons is \"dropped out,\" forcing the model to learn more robust representations.\n",
    "    - Benefit: Increases generalization, preventing the model from memorizing specific training examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "For finding the best activation function and dropout value for model accuracy, the following `test_loop` was run."

    "This was a weird result contradicting our hypothesis. However on further investigation, the loss of accuracy can be attributed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loss of Color Information\n",
    "    - Many images contain essential features in color escpecially the text having the same color but in grayscale, it is harder to differentiate between the text and the noise. Removal of the color channel information, reduces accuracyy as it is important for distinguishing between noise and text.\n",
    "2. Reduced Feature Space\n",
    "    - Color images (RGB) have three channels, meaning the model gets three different views of the same image. Grayscale images have only one channel, reducing the amount of information available to learn meaningful patterns.\n",
    "3. Weaker Edge Detection\n",
    "    - CNNs often learn to detect edges and textures early in the network, and color can play a crucial role in detecting these edges. When converted to grayscale, color-based contrast and edge information is lost.\n",

    "Running the same code on bonus set results in a similar (or in this speciific case better) accuracy which can be attributed to \n",
    "1. The bonus set has a background that is either green or red, while the hard set always has a white background. Since text color in the bonus set is always black, the contrast between text and background is high, making it easier for the CNN to distinguish characters. In contrast, the hard set uses random text colors on a white background, which can sometimes result in lower contrast (e.g., light-colored text on white), making character recognition harder.\n",
    "2. CNNs can learn to handle predictable transformations (like reversing text) which does not have a negative effect in classification.\n",
    "3. Both datasets add random noise, but in the hard set, the combination of random text colors and random noise makes feature extraction more difficult. In the bonus set, even with noise, the black text remains highly visible due to strong contrast.\n",
    "4. In the hard set, the text color changes along with the font, adding more complexity. The CNN has to learn both color variation and font variation at the same time, making it harder to generalize."
